Welcome to Version: Jaipur 🌆++.

Using the same version name, cause why not?
Never got the chance to flex cause of the fight, Jaipur++

New Angle, New Dimension, New Lights, New Position 🌏💫
Experience your home with a whole new face 🏠!

P.S. Judging by the size of the update, don't get so excited to open the app directly, delete the .apk first, after the update!
Re-add the widget to make it work!
