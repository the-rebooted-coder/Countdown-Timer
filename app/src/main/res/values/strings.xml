    <string name="greeting">Dear Bhumi, ❤️\n\nToday, I stand before you with immense pride and admiration in my heart. You\'ve done it!\n\nYou\'ve embarked on a journey that marks a significant milestone in your life.\nLiving alone for 15 days, away from the comforts of home, is no small feat, and it\'s something to cherish and celebrate 🥳.\n\nToday, I stand before you with immense pride and admiration in my heart. You\'ve done it!\n\nThese past two weeks have shown your incredible strength, resilience, and determination.\n\nYou\'ve faced challenges, embraced new experiences, and grown in ways you might not have even imagined.\n\nYou\'ve proven that you can thrive independently, and that\'s a remarkable achievement.\n\nBut what makes this accomplishment even more special is knowing that, even after this Rakshabandhan vacation, you\'ll find unwavering support waiting for you when you return to your hostel. In this vast world, where we often feel like tiny specks, it\'s the people who stand by us during our moments of growth and self-discovery that truly matter 🚀.\n\nBhumi, you are not alone on this journey. You have friends and loved ones who are here to celebrate your triumphs, offer a shoulder to lean on during your challenges, and be the constant presence that brings comfort and joy to your life, pomish🙃.\n\nAs you continue to explore, face new adventures, and achieve even greater milestones, remember that your support system is always here, cheering you on from the sidelines.\n\nYour determination and courage is amazing, and I have no doubt that you will go on to achieve incredible things in life 😀.\n\nCongratulations on this remarkable achievement, Bhumi.\n\nHere\'s to many more adventures, challenges conquered, and dreams fulfilled 🥂.\n\nYou\'ve done it, and I couldn\'t be prouder!\nWith heartfelt admiration,\n\nYour\nAnshu 💖.</string>
